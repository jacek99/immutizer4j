# immutizer4j

Library to validate immutability of Java object graphs

This library can validate an entire Java object graph and verify all of its elements are truly immutable.
To be immutable all fields must be final and the only collections allowed are Google Guava Immutable Collections.

# Usage

TODO

# Adding custom immutable types

TODO

# Creating immutable classes with Lombok

We recommend using **Lombok** to easily create immutable objects in Java using **@Value**:
